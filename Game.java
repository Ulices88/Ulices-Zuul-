/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "Bumi's Ghost Adventure" it is a very 
 *  simple, text based adventure game about a ghost named Bumi.  Users 
 *  can walk around some scenery through a graveyard as they try to make their
 *  way to ghost mountain. 
 *  That's all. 
 *
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 * 
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
